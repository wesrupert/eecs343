Wes Rupert - EECS 343
---

My solutions to the homework assignments for Case Western Reserve University's Spring 2013 EECS 345 class. Note these are my pesonal answers to the homeworks, and I assume no responsibility for plagarized work. This is here merely for the version control, and I'm too broke to pay for private repos. Use at your own risk.
